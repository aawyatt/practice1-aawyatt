I tell people that my field of study is taking data, manipulating it, and using it to make informed decisions. 

**I say something similar, just in further layman's terms. For a basic description, I say that I take confusing data and put it into a format that people with no experience can understand.**

-That I work with numbers and I am doing this so I can do analytics in baseball.

In the past month, the three main activities I do when I study are rewrite and summarize notes, watch videos on how to do certain types of problems, and complete homework. 

**I believe I may have misinterpreted this question! I would agree with your response though, rewriting and summarizing as well as completing and recompleting homework are great study strategies.**

-I have been playing softball, doing homework, and studying for exams. (I definitly misinterpret this question (LOL)) So my new answer is that I agree, I write note cards and work on practice problems and look over my notes. 

The three most important tools I use for organizing my work are Microsoft OneNote to keep track of deadlines, planners and notebooks to organize notes and written homework, and a file system on my computer to keep track of online homework and files. 

**I am similar in that I use online planners and file systems. I also like to use to-do lists to have an idea of what may be coming.**

-I type out all my homework for the week in my notes app; I even out my homework daily so I don't feel overwhelmed; and every morning I make a list of things I need to do in that day.
